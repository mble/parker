## What is Parker?

Parker is a lightweight HipChat notifier for priority bugs.

I intend to expand this into something a bit more meaty in the near
future. Right now it serves only to solve a particular problem.

It utilises [hipchat-rb](https://github.com/hipchat/hipchat-rb) for the [Hipchat API](https://www.hipchat.com/docs/apiv2) and [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) for the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/).
